# 3ERT-clomiphene-docking
This repository contains molecular docking studies of Human Estrogen Receptor Alpha (ERÎ±, PDB ID: 3ERT) with Clomiphene and its derivatives.

ðŸ“ŒIntroduction
Human Estrogen Receptor Alpha (ERÎ±) is a nuclear hormone receptor that regulates gene expression in response to estrogen. It plays a central role in reproductive development, bone health, cardiovascular function, and is a key target in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.

This  focuses on molecular docking of ERÎ± (PDB ID: 3ERT) with Clomiphene and its derivatives. Clomiphene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) widely used in infertility treatment. By docking Clomiphene and its derivatives with ERÎ±, we aim to analyze their binding affinities and interaction profiles.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

1.Prepare the protein structure (3ERT) for docking.
2.Prepare Clomiphene and its derivatives as ligands.
3.Perform molecular docking simulations.
4.Compare binding affinities and interactions.
5.Identify key residues involved in ligandâ€“protein binding.

Conclusion: 
Compound Performance: The compounds with the provided binding energies (-9.5, -9.4, -9.3 
kcal/mol) demonstrate strong binding affinities to the 3ERT receptor. Among them, 
4_COMPOUND_CID_194701 is the most promising due to its slightly higher binding affinity. 
Clomiphene: To accurately place Clomiphene within this ranking, its exact docking energy needs 
to be compared. If Clomiphene's docking energy is within or better than the range of -9.5 to -9.3 
kcal/mol, it would be considered an effective binder to the 3ERT receptor.
